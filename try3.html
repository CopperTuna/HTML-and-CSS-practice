          Their common names came from their slanted swimming style in which the
          head points toward the surface and the tail dips down at a 45-degree
          angle.

          Their body is shiny silver, narrow, and curved like the blade part of
          a hatchet. They tend to surf around the water surface with their fins
          out like little wings, looking for small foods floating up top.

          Aplocheilus lineatus is a gorgeous (and hardy) centerpiece fish that
          gets up to 4 inches (10cm) long. The male is more colorful and has a
          brilliant yellow body with a blue-green sheen and orange edging on its
          tail and fins.

          Growing up to 5 inches (13 cm) in length, the freshwater butterfly
          fish belongs in a 30-gallon or larger aquarium with no small tank
          mates.

        <div class="item-description">
          They're very fast and eat almost anything, so don't mix them with
          slower fish like long-tailed guppies that might get outcompeted during
          mealtimes.

          Yes, bettas will technically swim all over the aquarium, but if your
          tank is set up correctly, they do prefer to hang out in the upper
          third level.

        <div class="item-description">
          Like other killifish, it needs a close-fitting top to prevent escape
          and can live in cooler temperatures from 74-76&deg;F (23-24&deg;C).

        <div class="item-description">
          Some halfbeak species require brackish water, so do your research and
          stick with the Celebes, silver, and golder halfbeaks for freshwater
          only tanks.

        <div class="item-description">
          Guppies are live-bearing, so your children can get a biology lesson,
          too. Some varieties have elaborate fins and brilliant colors to make
          them fun to watch.

          Like the Guppy, he is peaceful and forgiving of water conditions. He
          gets a bit larger, growing up to 2 inches if he has the real estate.

        <div class="item-description">
          The Swordtail is also a live-bearing fish. However, he's not
          aggressive, as his name may suggest. It refers to the long tail that
          the male has.
